Welcome the Manhattan Rental Trends App
Coded by: Jason Phillip <Jason.Phillip@gmail.com>

This app is designed to provide landlords and brokers with a comprehensive view of the rental market's conditions over time. By offering data on rental rates, it helps
ensure that apartments are priced correctly when their lease is up for renewal. While most residential leases are for one year, the app also includes data for longer
time frames, which is especially useful when rent has not been adjusted for several years.

The app features three tabs on the left-hand side that allow the user to easily view different trends for a selected period of time. The first tab displays a page with the
asking median rent, while the second shows the number of listings on the market, and the third shows the percentage of listings that have discounted their asking price. Each
page features a line graph and three informative boxes that display the starting value, ending value, and the amount of change over the selected period of time.

To provide maximum flexibility, users can filter the data by apartment size, neighborhood, and time frame. Additionally, if an apartment is located on the border of multiple
neighborhoods, the user can select more than one neighborhood for a more accurate view of the data. The infoboxes will show the average of all selected neighborhoods, making it easy 
to compare different areas.
