Welcome the Manhattan Rental Trends App
Coded by: Jason Phillip <Jason.Phillip@gmail.com>

The purpose of this app is to allow landlords and brokers to view how the rental market conditions have changed over a period of time.  When an apartment lease is up for renewal, landlords and brokers need data so they can price the apartment correctly. Most residential leases are only for a year, however I included a longer time frame for situations where the rent has not been changed for several years.

The tabs on the left allow the user to view three different trends over a selected period of time.   The first tab brings the user to a page that shows the asking median rent , the second shows the amount of listings on the market, and the third shows the percent of listings that have discounted their asking price.   Each of these three pages has a line graph and three infoboxes.  The infoboxes show the starting value, ending value and the amount of change over the selected period of time.  The user can filter the data by apartment size, neighborhood and time frame.  More than neighborhoods can be selected for situations where an apartment is located on the border of one or more neighborhoods. The infoboxes will show the average of all neighborhoods selected.
